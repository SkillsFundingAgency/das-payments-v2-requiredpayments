## How It Works

The required payments service is responsible for calculating the how much should be paid for the earning in each period.  It will use the output from the DC earnings calc and also look at previous payments for the same period and determine how much should be paid.  This service will publish calculated levied payment, calculated co-invested payments and calculated incentive payments
