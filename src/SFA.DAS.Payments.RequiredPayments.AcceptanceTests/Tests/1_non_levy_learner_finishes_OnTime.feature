	| PriceEpisodeIdentifier | Delivery Period	| TransactionType   | Amount	|

	| p2                     | 2 				| Completion (TT2)	| 3000		|


Scenario: 1_non_levy_learner_finishes_OnTime - with history
	Given the following historical contract type 2 payments exist:

	| p2                     | 1				| Learning (TT1)	| 1000		|
